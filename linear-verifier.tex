\section{A Linear Verifier}\label{sec.verifier}

Now that we have developed our handover trees, let us describe how
a verifier bootstrapping from genesis and receiving \emph{all} the leaves of the tree
could verify their veracity. This verifier will not be efficient, but
we will use him as a stepping stone for developing a succinct verifier
later.

The verifier's job at this point will be to check that:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The leaves are syntactically valid. Every $j^\text{th}$ leaf
        consists of a
        pair whose first element $\overline{pk}_j$
        is a sequence of $2k$ public keys and whose second element
        $\overline\sigma_j$ is a
        sequence of $k+1$ signatures, except for the last leaf which consists
        simply of a sequence $\overline{pk}_n$ of $2k$ public keys.
  \item The first leaf corresponds to the known \emph{genesis} pair
        $(\overline{pk}[0], \overline{\sigma}[0])$.
  \item Each $j^\text{th}$ leaf's sequence $\overline{pk}_j$ of public
        keys is signed by each of the $k+1$ signatures
        $\overline\sigma_{j-1}$ in the previous leaf
        and is verifiable using $k+1$ of the $2k$ public keys
        of $\overline{pk}_{j-1}$, each in a distinct position
        in the sequence.
\end{enumerate}
