\section{Conclusion}

We have presented the first Proof of Proof-of-Stake protocol that allows synchronization
with logarithmic communication complexity. Our construction is simple and in the standard
model: we only rely on deterministic and unique signatures as well as hash functions. Our
construction is interactive and relies on a bisection game played between a verifier and
a set of provers, at least one of which is honest. We showed that our protocol is secure
and succinct, and discussed how it can be used to bootstrap wallets as well as a building
block for cross-chain interactions with proof-of-stake chain sources. As all previous
constructions were linear in the execution time, our construction is an exponential
improvement over previous work. We hope that, as proof-of-stake blockchains become
more popular, our protocol will be adopted at the heart of proof-of-stake mobile wallets
to achieve better bootstrapping performance without a sacrifice in security and without
reliance on trusted third parties.
